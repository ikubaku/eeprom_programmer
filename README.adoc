* [x] Random byte write / read
* [ ] Page write
* [ ] Sequential Read
* [ ] Copy data in an EEPROM to another one
* [ ] The batch mode interface for interactions using other CLI / GUI tools
* [x] Device firmware update over UART(needs a MCU with the DFU functionality)

== Prerequisites
=== Hardware
* A STM32G0xx series MCU
* Other nice parts

=== Software
* Rust(stable)
* Any serial terminal software you like

== Hardware Specifications
